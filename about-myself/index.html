            <h2>Why AltSchool?</h2>
            <p>As a Platform Integration Engineer, I've honed my skills in API integrations. I've had the opportunity to
                work on several integration projects, which has solidified my passion for leveraging technology to drive
                innovation.
                However, I aspire to take my career to the next level by transitioning into a DevOps role. Altschool
                Africa's engineering program offers the ideal platform to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge.
                The curriculum's focus on automation, infrastructure as code, and cloud technologies aligns perfectly
                with the demands of modern DevOps practices. I am particularly interested in the operations of DevOps as
                it relates with Cloud Infrastructures. I believe that by mastering these tools and technologies, I can
                contribute significantly to the efficiency and reliability of software delivery pipelines.
                Furthermore, Altschool Africa's emphasis on real-world problem-solving and hands-on projects will
                provide me with the practical experience to tackle complex challenges in a DevOps environment. I am
                eager to collaborate with talented peers and learn from experienced faculty to develop a strong
                foundation in DevOps principles.
                I am confident that a degree in engineering from Altschool Africa will not only solidify my technical
                skills but also enhance my leadership, problem-solving, and communication abilities. I am excited about
                the opportunity to contribute to the school's vibrant community and make a lasting impact on the tech
                industry.</p>
